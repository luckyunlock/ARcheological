# ARcheological
The repo contains the implementation of a Unity AR experience built for the Augmented Reality Interfaces exam (Masaryk University of Brno, CZ - A.Y. 2019).
It represents my first attempt at creating a game using Unity, C# and ARToolKit technologies.

The project implements a POC of an AR quiz game set in an underwater environment. Scene can be opened and navigated by scanning a QrCode marker with a mobile device having the app installed. Users can gain knowledge about the main scene item and then 
answer questions. The main game goal is to learn more about the underwater environment and obtain virtual coins by answering some questions correctly before the timer expires.
